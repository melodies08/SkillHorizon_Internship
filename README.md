This repository contains my **learning journey, practice tasks, and assignments** completed during the **Skill Horizon Cybersecurity Internship (September 2025)**.
The aim of this repo is to **document daily progress, practice tasks, tools used, and screenshots/reports** for future reference.


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Maintain a structured record of all internship assignments.
* Practice and document tools, scripts, and techniques learned during sessions.
* Include **commands, outputs, screenshots, and findings** for each task.
* Build a **portfolio-style repository** to showcase cybersecurity skills.
* Keep the repo scalable to add **more assignments in the future**.


## ðŸš€ How to Navigate

* Each **Assignment** has its own folder.
